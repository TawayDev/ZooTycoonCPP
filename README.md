### Assignment
1. ‚úÖ You can come up with assignments (other than those from lectures) yourself, but the project must contain at least seven
   classes.
2. ‚úÖ Part of the project will be the own proposal described in text form and supplemented with a UML diagram
   classes (or another scheme clearly describing the relationships between classes).
3. ‚úÖ The project will contain objects (hierarchies).
4. The project will contain and use overloaded methods.
5. ‚úÖ The project will contain and use a class in the role of an object.
6. ‚úÖ The project will contain and use an inheritance hierarchy containing at least three classes.
7. ‚ùìInheritance will include and use both extensions (data and methods) and change behavior with usage
   late binding.
8. ‚úÖ The inheritance hierarchy will contain a purely abstract class.
9. ‚ùå The project will use polymorphism (polymorphic assignment and polymorphic data structure).
10. ‚ùì After starting the project, at least several dozen objects will be created, including all the objects
    of declared classes (except for abstract ones) and will be years in the console listing
    the results of tasks that objects perform.

### How does it work ?
#### Class hierarchy:
- Zoo holds a vector of Enclosures
- Animal (Abstract) is extended by:
  - Mammal 
  - Bird
  - Reptile
#### How to use this?
By pressing keys in `<>` such as `e<X>it` you perform certain actions. Limited to one action per in-game day.
### NOTE:
- Some tasks could not be completed due to simplistic nature of the project. Adding "creation of several dozen objects upon startup"
is not possible due to the nature of the program. 
- The whole project is coded in a horrible unprofessional spaghetti code mess that would impress every italian chef.
